  # Description
  Note-Taker allows the user to take and store notes via an app deployed through heroku. This project combines Front-End frameworks with Back-End express frameworks. The user types a note into the deployed application. It is then stored both on the UI and in the JSON for reference. The user has the ability to create multiple notes and delete them upon request.The application uses API calls to GET, POST and DELETE information.
